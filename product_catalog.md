If you have a passion for coffee, you may be interested in starting your own coffee shop. However, as with the start of any business, careful planning is essential. Thorough research, site selection and detailed planning will start you on the road to success, well before you serve the first latte.

Develop a Business Plan
One of the most important steps to starting a business is to write a detailed business plan, which forces you to think through all the aspects of planning and structuring your company. Take the time to research the industry and local marketplace so that you know where to position your shop within the market. Plan for the following segments of your company:

Mission and branding of your coffee shop.
Market analysis. Know your competition.
Drinks and menu items you will offer.
Management structure and staffing.
Marketing plan.
Startup costs and financial projections:
Choose a Location Wisely
It's true that location is everything, especially if your business depends on customers being able to find you. Consider more than just the price per square foot when looking for a rental space. Convenient parking, proximity to entertainment venues, easy access to heavily traveled roads or busy shopping districts are all important factors that could affect the amount of business driven to your shop.

Develop a Brand Identity
Although the U.S. coffee industry is expected to continue growing, competition is stiff, so it is essential to position yourself strategically within your local market. Understand how many and what type of other coffee shops are in your area and then determine how to set yourself apart. Decide how to fill a need within your community and brand your shop toward that niche. Some ideas to consider include:

Convenience: quick in and out, drive-up service, grab-n-go breakfasts.
Community gathering spot: book club offerings, live music, kid-friendly.
Cafe style: extensive menu selections for more than just coffee.
Workspace: free Wi-Fi and large tables for meetings.
Make It Legal 
You also need to handle all the legal aspects of setting up your business. An accountant or small business adviser can provide you with guidance. Some of the items to take care of include:

Deciding on a business structure such as an LLC, sole proprietor, partnership or corporation .
Applying for a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN).
Applying for a state business entity number and sales license.
Getting approval for food service licensing.
Renovate and Furnish Your Shop
Based on your brand concept, renovate your shop with an appropriate layout for seating, coffee service and foot traffic within the store. Keep in mind that small touches like lighting, decor and plants can provide atmosphere for your shop.

Market Your Coffee Shop
Marketing your new business begins before you open the doors. Take advantage of traditional marketing strategies such as developing a website or drumming up interest via social media but also work at connecting with the community.

Hand out free samples at a community fair or send flyers to local businesses and give them a sample muffin tray. Place a discount coupon in the local paper. Make a splash on your storefront, especially if you are sprucing up the outside; use the opportunity to create interest in "what's happening in that spot?"

Estimate Annual Revenue
How much money you make depends on a great many factors including:

The number of daily sales.
The average amount per receipt.
The number of ongoing return customers.
Your ability to increase the amount per receipt.
Your ability to increase the number of sales.
Your costs.
As a baseline, if you have 100 transactions per day and the average sales receipt is $5, you make $500 per day and about $15,000 each month, assuming you are open every day. In one year, you would bring in $180,000 in gross revenue. For many shops, sales often double within three to five years. However, you must also account for expenses, including rent, employee salaries, insurance, utilities and supplies to determine your profit.

The key to increasing your profit margin is to increase both sales and gross receipts, as some of your expenses will remain fixed. On average, within the industry, a small to medium-sized coffee shop can earn anywhere from $60,000 to $160,000 in personal income for the shop owner.
